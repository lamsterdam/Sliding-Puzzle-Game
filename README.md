This sliding puzzle game is a game that involves moving puzzle pieces to unscramble a puzzle. The player is able to load various puzzles, choose the number of chances(moves) they would like and attempts to solve the puzzle by clicking on puzzle pieces. The game keeps track of player clicks, and compares the current tile positions to the correct puzzle layout to verify if the game board is in the winning sequence.
